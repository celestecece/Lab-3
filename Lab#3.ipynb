    "#Purpose:Pancreatic lipase plays a critical role in the digestion of fats, but when isolated, it proves ineffective due to its water-soluble nature attempting to act on sizable lipid droplets that resist water. Bile salts address this challenge by functioning as emulsifying agents, breaking down fats into smaller droplets. This process enhances the surface area available for lipase to efficiently hydrolyze fats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pancreas further facilitates lipid digestion by releasing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). This compound establishes a pH of approximately 7.8 in the small intestine, creating an optimal environment for the activity of pancreatic enzymes. In these exercise, various facets of the interaction between pancreatic lipase, bile salts, and lipids will be explored.\n"

    "1.)An enzyme is a biological catalyst, typically a protein, that facilitates and accelerates biochemical reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Enzymes operate by binding to specific substrates, forming enzyme-substrate complexes, and catalyzing the conversion of substrates into products. \n",
    "The active site of an enzyme provides a specific binding site for the substrate, and the enzyme undergoes conformational changes during the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The activity of enzymes is influenced by pH and temperature. Enzymes have optimal pH and temperature ranges for their function, \n",
    "and deviations from these ranges can lead to denaturation, affecting the enzyme's activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Digestion involves the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler forms, often facilitated by enzymes, to make nutrients available for absorption. \n",
    "Emulsification is the process of breaking down large fat globules into smaller droplets, typically aided by substances like bile salts, increasing the \n",
    "surface area for enzymatic action.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Indicators are substances that change color based on the pH of a solution, providing a visual representation of pH changes during experiments. \n",
    "Buffers help maintain a stable pH by resisting changes when an acid or base is added, ensuring optimal conditions for enzyme activity in this context.\n",
